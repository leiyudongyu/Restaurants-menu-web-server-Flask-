# Web application of restaurants and corresponding menus using Flask framwork and sqlite database

This is one of web project in Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree in Udacity.

In this project, I have wrote sql scheme, built an web server using flask framwork of python and using SQLalchemy API to connect the sqlite database. I made a web application which can provide CRUD method to a list of restaurant and its menus.

1. Run database_setup.py to create restaurantmenu.db
2. Run project.py to connect the sqlite database and webserver
3. Go to http://localhost:5000/ and you will see the page as below
